# Employee-Sales-Income-Calculator

This is a small python program that calculates the sales income of an employee who is paid on a commission basis. As sales increases, the commission rate and the admin fee rises. The employee must pay the admin fee to "The Sales Company", and can be in a loss position if the sales commission earned is less than the admin fee plus the payment advance.
